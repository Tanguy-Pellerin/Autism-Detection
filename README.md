# Autism-Detection

This project was about building a Deep Learning algorithm in order to detect Austim Sprectrum Disorder.

You will have [PCP.html](https://github.com/Tanguy-Pellerin/Autism-Detection/blob/main/PCP.html), that we used to preprocessing the data, and use data augmentation to have more data.

And [Model.html](https://github.com/Tanguy-Pellerin/Autism-Detection/blob/main/Model.html), that we used to train our model.
